# CS-210 Portfolio â€” Corner Grocer Project

This repository contains my **Corner Grocer Project** from CS-210. This project demonstrates my ability to write readable, maintainable, and functional C++ code. It highlights skills in program design, problem-solving, and applying industry standards in coding.

## Reflection

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**  
The Corner Grocer project was designed to read a list of grocery items from a file and track their purchase frequencies. The program outputs the frequency of specific items, the full list with counts, and a histogram for easy visualization. It solved the problem of helping a small business manage and analyze product frequency data.

**What did you do particularly well?**  
I did particularly well in structuring the program into multiple files (`main.cpp`, `itemTracking.cpp`, `itemTracking.h`) to improve readability and organization. I also handled file input/output cleanly so the program could reliably process the data.

**Where could you enhance your code?**  
I could enhance my code by adding more robust error handling, such as validating user input and ensuring the input file exists before attempting to read it. These improvements would make the program more secure and user-friendly.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?**  
The most challenging part was building the frequency-tracking logic and making sure the program updated item counts correctly. I overcame this by breaking the task into smaller functions and using maps to efficiently track items. Documentation and testing after each function helped me debug issues.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**  
Skills in file input/output, data structures (maps), and modular program design will be highly transferable. The project also strengthened my debugging and problem-solving skills, which apply to all future programming tasks.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
I separated the logic into header and implementation files, used clear function names, and added comments to explain the code. This makes the program easy to maintain, extend with new features, and adapt to different datasets in the future.
